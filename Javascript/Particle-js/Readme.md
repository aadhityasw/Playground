## List of Projects

### 1. Github Readme Header

I have utilized this for creating a particle effect which I have used for the Readme page in my repository.

The particle effect created looks as follows :
![demo](./img/project1_demo.png)

In this project, I have not set up npm or any live server, I have just utilized the [particles.js](./Project-1/assets/js/particles.js) provided by the demo and have used the [app.js](./Project-1/assets/js/app.js) file to customize the particles and the links between them. All this and the required [styles](./Project-1/assets/css/style.css) is imported into the [index.html](Project-1/index.html) file which displays the required design.


Refer to my [Github Page](https://github.com/aadhityasw/aadhityasw/blob/main/README.md) for its implementation with some special effects applied.
