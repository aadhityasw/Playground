# C Programming Language


## Steps for Compilation and Execution

You can follow these steps if you use the `gcc` compiler :

* Compile a c file :
```bash
    gcc <name_of_file.c>
```
			--> This compiles the file

* Execute the output file
```bash
./a.out
```
			--> This runs the file

You can change the name of the output file by using the `-o` flag during compilation, if nothing is specfied it defaults to `a.out`.
